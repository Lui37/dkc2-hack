#dkc2-hack
Donkey Kong Country 2 romhack for speedrun practice

To be assembled using [Asar](https://github.com/RPGHacker/asar), see the Makefile.

**Features**
- frame counter on the top right of the screen, in "m ss ff" (minutes, seconds, frames). ignores loading time during transitions
- pausing the game freezes the timer
- lag frame counter on the top left of the screen
- infinite lives
- DK coins will always respawn
- manage your kongs on the map (by BlueImp)
	- `L` to toggle between having 1 or 2 kongs
	- `R` to change which kong is in front

you're probably gonna need a completed save file for now, sorry
